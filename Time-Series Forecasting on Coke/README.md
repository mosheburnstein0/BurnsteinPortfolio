# Time-Series Forecasting on Coke

## Introduction
Is it a financially sound decision to accept a credit card cash offer at a 5% cost, with the goal of investing in CocaCola stock and making a profit? This project explores the feasibility and risks associated with such a decision, forecasting Coca Cola close prices for future time periods.

## Project Overview

- Key questions include the level of confidence in forecasting Coca Cola close prices and the associated risks.

## Data Sources
- Utilizing public, open-source financial databases and resources such as Yahoo Finance for Coca Cola stock (KO) data.
- Focus on essential features like time and closing prices, with potential consideration for multivariate analysis.

## Analysis Models
- Considering ARIMA, LSTM, and possibly SARIMA models based on seasonality.
- Utilizing the FB Prophet package, especially for hyperparameter tuning and LSTM models.
- Evaluation metrics include RMSE, MAE, MASE, and sMAPE for assessing model robustness.

## Ethical Considerations
- Emphasizing the disclaimer that past performance is not an indicator of future performance.
- Cautioning stakeholders not to rely solely on the model and suggesting risk mitigation strategies.
- Addressing ethical concerns related to model transparency, unfair advantage, and disclosure of stock holdings.
