## Presentation Highlights

### Upside Down Graph

This visual presents a misleading impression of a decrease in a certain metric after the enactment of a law. In reality, there was a spike in gun deaths, and the y-axis starting at 1000 instead of 0 contributes to the misrepresentation.

### Simpson's Paradox

The presentation discusses instances where aggregated views of data may not align with categorized views, leading to misinterpretations. Examples include the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and demographics of infected populations.

### Truncating the Graph

Graph truncation can exaggerate differences between data sets. The presentation showcases graphs where truncation misrepresents differences in tax rates and political opinions.

### Were We Mistaken?

The presentation questions whether reactions to certain events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, were justified. It explores visuals that may overstate or understate the severity of the situation.

### Overstating

Visuals that exaggerate differences in data, such as age group infection rates, are discussed. The presentation emphasizes the importance of accurate representation.

### Egregious

The presentation highlights a case where a graph presented by the Georgia Department of Health might not accurately represent the decline in COVID-19 rates due to the inconsistent order of months.

### Mask Mandates: Panacea?

An analysis of visuals related to mask mandates is presented, showcasing instances where the use of two vertical axes with different scales can lead to misinterpretations.
